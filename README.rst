About
=====


This is an attempt to provide a comprehensive visualization of the
Tree of Life in a graph-like manner, considering the existing conflicts
that transfor the Tree into an actual Directed Acyclic Graph.

It consists of a Service and a Web presentation:

 * Service: A simple Python web service that connects to the neo4j instance
 * Web: a set of html, js and css files that make the visualization
